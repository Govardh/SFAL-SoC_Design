<h2>What is an SoC</h2>
A System-on-Chip (SoC) is an IC or single-die chip that has some different IP cores, that consolidates all the components required for a functional system onto a single chip. It typically includes a central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output ports, and secondary processing units like graphics processing units (GPUs) or digital signal processors (DSPs). SoCs are designed for specific applications, ranging from smartphones and tablets to embedded systems in cars and medical devices. By integrating multiple functions into a single chip, SoCs reduce size, power consumption, and cost, while improving performance and efficiency. This makes them a cornerstone of modern electronics, particularly in devices where space and energy efficiency are critical

VSDBabySoC is a small,  powerful RISCV-based SoC. The main purpose of the SoC is to test three open-source IP cores together for the first time and calibrate the analog part of it. VSDBabySoC contains one RVMYTH microprocessor, an 8x-PLL to generate a stable clock, and a 10-bit DAC to communicate with other analog devices.
This project demonstrates how these modules are integrated together to form a basic SoC, and focuses on simulating and verifying the design behavior both **before** and **after synthesis**. The goal is to check the functionality and performance of the system through these simulation stages.
## What is RVMYTH

RVMYTH core is a simple RISCV-based CPU, introduced in a workshop by RedwoodEDA and VSD. During a 5-day workshop students (including middle-schoolers) managed to create a processor from scratch. The workshop used the TLV for faster development. All of the present and future contributions to the IP will be done by students and under open-source licenses.

## What is PLL

A phase-locked loop or PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. PLLs are widely used for synchronization purposes, including clock generation and distribution.

## What is DAC

A digital-to-analog converter or DAC is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal. DACs are widely used in modern communication systems enabling the generation of digitally-defined transmission signals. As a result, high-speed DACs are used for mobile communications and ultra-high-speed DACs are employed in optical communications systems.

# VSDBabySoC Modeling

Here we are going to model and simulate the VSDBabySoC using `iverilog`, then we will show the results using `gtkwave` tool. Some initial input signals will be fed into `vsdbabysoc` module that make the pll start generating the proper `CLK` for the circuit. The clock signal will make the `rvmyth` to execute instructions in its `imem`. As a result the register `r17` will be filled with some values cycle by cycle. These values are used by dac core to provide the final output signal named `OUT`. So we have 3 main elements (IP cores) and a wrapper as an SoC and of-course there would be also a testbench module out there.
### Project Structure
The project is organized in the following way:
- **`src/include/`**: This directory contains **header files** (with `.vh` extension) that define key **macros** and **parameters** for the SoC design. These may include configuration settings like clock frequencies, reset behaviors, or other design-specific constants.
  
- **`src/module/`**: This directory contains the **Verilog files** that define the logic and behavior of the individual modules in the SoC. These include the Verilog code for the RISC-V processor, PLL, DAC, and possibly other supporting modules.

- **`output/`**: The **output directory** is where all the generated files from the compilation and simulation processes will be stored. This includes compiled files, waveform files, and any other results generated from running simulations.
